Otaku Meets is a blind-dating website for Anime enthusiasts. It is designed to help users communicate with each other based on their personality type by using the [**Myers Briggs Type Indicator**](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/home.htm?bhcp=1). For example: you wouldn't want to approach an introvert with extroverted scenarios. Instead you would ease them in slowly and not come on too strong.

## Inspiration

This apps *styling* was heavily inspired by [**OKCupid**](https://www.okcupid.com/)'s landing page, signup & log in pages. As well as [**Tinder**](https://tinder.com/)'s layout design & functionality. I, by no means copied their CSS, but instead used their pages as reference and styled accordingly.
