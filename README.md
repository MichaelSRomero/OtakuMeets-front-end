Otaku Meets is a blind-dating website for Anime enthusiasts. It is designed to help users communicate with each other based on their personality type by using the [**Myers Briggs Type Indicator**](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/home.htm?bhcp=1). For example: you wouldn't want to approach an introvert with extroverted scenarios. Instead you would ease them in slowly and not come on too strong.

## Inspiration

I built this site because I wanted to provide a different change and twist to online dating. We often first get attracted by another person via Physicalness; how they look, how they dress. And that's completely fine, but I felt the need to try and provide attraction through personalities. After all, what good is a beautiful person if they have an ugly personality?

This apps *styling* was heavily inspired by [**OKCupid**](https://www.okcupid.com/)'s landing page, signup & log in pages. As well as [**Tinder**](https://tinder.com/)'s layout design & functionality. I, by no means copied their CSS, but instead used their pages as reference and styled accordingly.
